   - `git branch <branch-name>` - Creates a new branch.
   - `git checkout <branch-name>` - Switches to the specified branch.
   - `git branch -d <branch-name>` - Deletes the specified branch.
   - `git branch -m <new-branch-name>` - Renames the current branch.
   - `git branch` - shows all local branches.
   - `git branch -a` - shows all local, remote head pointing to which remote branch remote branches and orgin over here is an alias of repo url `git remote -v`

4. **Switch Branch:**
   - `git checkout <branch-name>` - Switches to the specified branch.

## Staging and Committing:
5. **Stage Changes:**
   - `git add <file(s)>` - Adds specific files to the staging area.
   - `git add .` - Adds all changes in the working directory to the staging area.
   - `git add -A` - (Alternative for adding all changes)

6. **Commit Changes:**
   - `git commit -m "Your message"` - Commits the staged changes with a descriptive message. Remember, friendly commit messages make collaboration more enjoyable!

## Merging and Remote Operations:
7. **Merge Branches:**
   - `git checkout <target-branch>` - Switches to the target branch.
   - `git merge <source-branch>` - Merges changes from the source branch into the target branch.

8. **Pull Changes from Remote:**
   - `git pull origin <branch-name>` - Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into the current branch.

9. **Push Changes to Remote:**
   - `git push origin <branch-name>` - Pushes local changes to the remote repository.

## Repository Status and History:
10. **Check Repository Status:**
    - `git status` - Displays the status of the working directory.

11. **View Commit History:**
    - `git log` - Shows the commit history.

    - `git tag <tag-name>` - Creates a tag for the current commit.

23. **Push Tags to Remote:**
    - `git push --tags` - Pushes tags to the remote repository.

24. **Resolve Merge Conflicts:**
    - Manually edit conflicting files and then `git add` and `git commit` - Resolves conflicts during a merge.

25. **Ignore and Rebase:**
    - Create a `.gitignore` file. Add unwanted files or folders (e.g., __pycache__/, .env, *.log) to .gitignore. This is helpful password docs.
    - `git rebase <base-branch>` - Rebases the current branch onto the specified base branch.
    - `git rebase -i <base-branch>` - Interactive rebase, allowing modification of commit history.

26. **Bisect and Archive:**
    - `git bisect start`, `git bisect good`, `git bisect bad` - Helps find the commit that introduced a bug.
    - `git archive --format=zip --output=<output-filename>.zip <branch-name>` - Creates a zip archive of a specific branch.

27. **Submodules:**
    - `git submodule add <repository-url> <path>` - Adds a submodule.

## Naming Conventions:
28. **Folder and File Naming Conventions:**
    - **Folders:**
      - Use lowercase letters.
      - Separate words with hyphens for folders.
      - Follow the same conventions as for subfolders as like folders.
    - **Files:**
      - Use lowercase letters.
      - Follow underscore separated for file names.
      - Follow underscore separated for cloud services as well (my preference - since underline service file whould have same name like service name to avoid confusion).
      - Descriptive names, indicating the file's purpose.
      - Exception -> README.md in parent directory, although in sub-directories it should follow lower case as readme.md like any oher files

## Pythonic ENV setup:
29. **micromamba:**
   - ```bash
      # Linux/macOS (bash/zsh):
      curl micro.mamba.pm/install.sh | bash
      
      # Windows (PowerShell):
      Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://micro.mamba.pm/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1
     
   - ```bash
      # Linux/macOS (bash/zsh):
      curl micro.mamba.pm/install.sh | bash
      
      # Windows (PowerShell):
      Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://micro.mamba.pm/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1
   - ```bash
      # ‚úÖ CREATE & MANAGE ENVIRONMENTS

      # Create environment with Python (no pip):
      micromamba create -n myenv python=3.11
      
      # Activate environment:
      micromamba activate myenv
      
      # Deactivate:
      micromamba deactivate
   - ```bash
      # üì¶ INSTALL PACKAGES

      # Install packages from conda-forge:
      micromamba install -n myenv numpy pandas
      
      # Avoid pip unless absolutely necessary (prefer conda-forge packages)
   - ```bash
      # üìù USING environment.yml (pip-free, recommended)

      # environment.yml
      name: myenv
      channels:
        - conda-forge
      dependencies:
        - python=3.11
        - numpy
        - pandas

   - ```bash
      # Create environment from environment.yml:
      micromamba create -f environment.yml

   - ```bash
      # üìù USING requirements.txt (fallback, pip-based)

      # Create env with pip if needed:
      micromamba create -n myenv python=3.11 pip
      micromamba activate myenv
      pip install -r requirements.txt

     # üö´ AVOIDING PIP WITH conda-lock (freeze envs)

      # Install conda-lock (once):
      micromamba install -n base conda-lock -c conda-forge
      
      # Generate lock file:
      conda-lock lock -p linux-64 -f environment.yml
      
      # Create from locked file:
      micromamba create -n myenv --file conda-lock.yml

     # üß† SHELL INTEGRATION (bash/zsh/fish)

      # Init shell:
      micromamba shell init -s bash -p ~/micromamba
      source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
      
      # Auto-activation in project:
      mkdir -p ./env
      micromamba create -y -p ./env python=3.11
      micromamba activate ./env

     # üßπ CLEANUP & INSPECT

      # List environments:
      micromamba env list
      
      # Remove environment:
      micromamba remove -n myenv --all
      
      # List installed packages:
      micromamba list

   - ```bash
      # üß© BEST PRACTICES

      - Use environment.yml + conda-lock for reproducibility
      - Stick to conda-forge packages (avoid pip when possible)
      - Use local envs with: micromamba create -p ./env
      - Perfect for CI/CD, Docker, project-level isolation
      - Faster and lighter than conda
     
## SSH Key Pair:
   - **Public Key:**
      - Shared openly, used for encryption and verification.
      - Placed on servers or platforms like GitHub for authentication. Whoever holds the private key is authenticated. Based on the identification accesses are allowed or restricted.
      - Does not compromise security if exposed.
   - **Private Key:**
      - Kept confidential, used for decryption and signing.
      - Possession proves identity during authentication.
      - Never shared or exposed to maintain security.

## Authentication:
   - Process of proving your identity using the private key.
   - Successful authentication grants access based on authorization.

## Secure Channel:
   - Established after authentication, encrypting all subsequent communication.
   - Unique set of encryption and decryption keys for each session.
   - Ensures confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged.


## GIT SSH Keys Setup Guide:
   - https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
   - `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "mail-id-optional"`
   - copy and add the public key(id_ed25519.pub) content in github
   - create config ```bash touch cd /home/ubuntu/.ssh/config```
   - Contents in config:
     ```bash
     # GitHub Configuration
     Host github.com
        HostName github.com
        User git
        PreferredAuthentications publickey
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   - add ssh origin for error `git remote set-url origin <SSH_URL>`
   - `git archive --format=zip --output=<output-filename>.zip <branch-name>` - Creates a zip archive of a specific branch.

Remember to customize these guidelines based on your project's specific needs and workflows.

## Version Control Purpose

- Git serves as a robust version control system, tracking changes in files.
- Commits document changes, aiding in understanding modifications over time.

## Git Workflow

- Main and feature branches structure development.
- Clone, create local branches, push changes, create pull requests, and merge for a streamlined workflow.

## Commit Handling

- Text files: Commits capture delta changes efficiently.
- Binary files: Git replicates entire files for changes, ensuring comprehensive tracking.

## Difference Between "Pull" and "Merge"

- "Pull" fetches and merges changes from the remote repository into the local branch.

## Merge Concept

- Merging copies changes from one branch (or commit) into another, facilitating project cohesion.

## Fetch, Pull, Merge and Push Distinction

- `git fetch` brings remote changes to the local repository without creating commits.
- `git pull` fetches and merges changes automatically.
- `git push` shares local commits with the remote repository.
- `merge` happens automatically if there is no conflict. Conflict need to be resolved manually.

## Conflict Resolution

- Pulling when local commits are ahead may result in conflicts.
- Resolve conflicts manually, leading to a new commit reflecting merged changes.

## Commands

- **Clone:** `git clone [repository URL]`
- **Create Branch:** `git branch [branch name]`
- **Push Changes:** `git push origin [branch name]`
- **Create Pull Request:** Initiate on your Git hosting platform
- **Merge:** Post approval, merge the pull request
- **Fetch:** `git fetch`
- **Pull:** `git pull`
- **Push:** `git push`
